# Classification-Of-The-Animal-Kingdom
This repository was created for the classification of the Animal Kingdom, using Classes, objects and methods, making sure that all the principles of OOP is touched, and represented DUELY.

For A Recap, the four Principles of OOP that was shown in the code Includes: 

Inheritance: This is how a new class inherites the properties and methods of another class. This is done using the Keyword extend. In the code, the class withOutBackBone inherited the eat and move method from the General class Animalia.

Abstraction: In a simple term, is hiding the internal implementation details of an object, and only revealing operations that are relevant to the other object. In development, an ABSTRACT class is a class that all other class will inherit from. We call it the BASE class. This is because the class cannot be implemented or initialized directly. In the code, some of the base class there is Animalia, withBackBone etc. 

Polymorphism: In a simple term, is the ability of an object to take different forms. In development, this is a way of implementing the samething in different ways. This can be done using what we call Method override. This is overriding the parent base method that has already being declared. Looking at the code, you can see that both the eat and move method that is in Animalia, was overriden in the class withoutBackBone and withBackBone. 

Encapsulation: In a professional term, is the mechanism of binding data together into a single entity and hiding it or protecting the data from external sources or the outside world. By default, JavaScript methods inside their classes are public. we use the pound sign (#) to make a private method. In the code, in the class Fish, we made the swim method private, and created a public method that will be used to access it. In this case the movement method. 

Throught out the code, you will see these principles being applied fully. Thank You.
